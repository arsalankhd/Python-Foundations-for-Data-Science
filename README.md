# üêç Python Foundations for Data Science

## üìù Overview

This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch in Python. It serves as a showcase of core programming skills essential for data science and machine learning. The solutions cover topics in algorithms, object-oriented programming, and foundational machine learning concepts like optimization.

All implementations are contained within the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## üöÄ Implemented Exercises

This project includes Python solutions for the following problems:

1.  **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: A function to find the longest substring in a given string without any repeated characters.
2.  **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two integers.
3.  **Optimization Algorithms**:
    * **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A from-scratch implementation of the SGD optimizer to minimize a cost function.
    * **Adam Optimizer**: A from-scratch implementation of the Adam optimizer.
4.  **Find Missing Numbers**: A function that identifies missing numbers from a list containing integers from 1 to n.
5.  **Group Anagrams**: A function that groups a list of words into sublists of anagrams.
6.  **Merge Dictionaries**: A function to merge two dictionaries, summing the values for common keys.
7.  **Top K Frequent Words**: A function that returns the `k` most frequent words from a list, sorted by frequency and then alphabetically.
8.  **Generate Pascal's Triangle**: A function to generate Pascal's triangle up to a specified number of rows.
9.  **Find All Subsets (Power Set)**: A recursive function to find all possible subsets of a given list.
10. **Polynomial Class (OOP)**:
    * A `Polynomial` base class in a separate `Polynomial.py` file that supports addition, subtraction, and evaluation.
    * A `QuadraticPolynomial` subclass that inherits from `Polynomial` and includes a method to find its roots.
11. **Matrix Class (OOP)**: A `Matrix` class that supports basic matrix operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
